# Snake

Simple pixel art Snake game developed in Python using PyGame. 
There are two different game modes. 
One "normal" mode, where the user is controlling the snake using the arrows on the keyboard.
And an "automated" mode, where the snake is controlled by an SW agent.

The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm which is capable to solve the snake game in an efficient manner.
